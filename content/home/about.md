Building robust statistical infrastructure that ensure the collection and the analysis of statistical information to inform citizen, decision makers and scientists is a challenge for many country. Statistical systems have to balance the necessity of local relevance of the information they collect with the requirements of different levels of international norms. The mix of political and technical logics and constraints that have to be taken into account to design and implement national statistical stystems is increasingly complex to navigate, in a time when both innovations in data science and an evolving landscape of globalized actors radically redefine the global field of public measurement.

My work and research is aimed at disentangling these dyamics in the field of Global Health. Most of this work is oriented towards enabling local actors of health systems in low-resource settings to build national health information systems that are adequate and efficient. The projects I typically work on are of three types:

* **Tools development:**  I develop tools for health systems, to improve routine data collection and analysis. This line of work encompasses the adaptation of global data definitions to specific health systems, the comprehensive mapping of data requirements, and the development of tools adapted to local conditions of user.
* **Methods research:** The simplification of tools often requires a larger redistribution of the computational work in health information systems. This involves identifying the right level of aggregation for different metrics, developing innovative analytic approaches to make the best use of any data available, and testing and implementation new analytical methods.
* **Strategic reflection:** Disentangling technical and political dimensions of statistical systems is essential to orient methodological research and tool development. Different stakeholders need to differentiate the methodological requirements from the domains in which power relationship are exerted or where negotiations should take place. I develop frameworks to guide this analysis for national and local players.

In all of my projects, I aim at fostering the development of statistical systems as public goods. Such systems should serve most in need populations, by adequatly measuring their needs and by focusing on the proper representation of invisible and underserved populations.
