abstract = "This report draws from the Access, Bottlenecks, Costs, and Equity (ABCE) project in Kenya, a multi-pronged and multi-country research collaboration focused on understanding what drives and hinders health service provision. Results include  assessing the capacity of health facilities to provide services across different levels of care, such as physical infrastructure, human resources for health; and stocks of medicines and functional equipment; comparing patient reports of their experiences at facilities, including wait time for care, interactions with providers, and expenses incurred during their visit; tracking trends in patient volumes and spending across facility types; quantifying the relationship between facility resources and production of services; estimating facility costs associated with different types of services, with an expanded section on facility costs of HIV/AIDS care; examining characteristics of facility-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs, including trends in drug regimens provided and patient retention"
